title: Are we delocating the wasps, or are they delocating us?
---

This week, the heat arrived, and with it Daniel from London, who patiently helped us with some of the less savoury stuff - carrying tiles and other building materials from A to B. Not the most creative activity, but necessary to make room for the builders who will transform our stables into rooms.

When doing this work in summer, there is always the risk to encounter angry wasps protecting their nests. A very good training for developing fast reactions! RUN!!!

Pedro and Sarah spent a day at [Ananda Kalyani](https://anandakalyani.org/) to visit their annual festival and enjoyed a presentation about local economy, a nice yoga lesson, some kiirtan singing and plenty of interesting talks!
