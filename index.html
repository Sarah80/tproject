Welcome to Terlamonte Project</br></br>

We are a place of learning, teaching and experimentation, and our aim is to support sustainable startups in rural contexts. You can visit us and we will serve you a curriculum based on your needs and interests, or help you out with possible business ideas, in exchange for volunteer work. We are currently planning the layout of our place and are making the first steps towards a solar kitchen.
