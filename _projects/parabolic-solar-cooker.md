### The goal: build a solar cooker to bake bread and cook food

### What does it consist of?

- Parabolic mirror (polished aluminium)
- Car window lift motors to move the structure
- Oven tube to hold the food
- Control system to track the sun, sensor-based, running on Arduino, with 6 relays and 4 LDRs

### Problems

- Sensor-based system gets confused with a partially cloudy sky
- Very high risk of wind damage (the mirror is basically a giant sail)

### Pictures of the system



### Useful resources

- The original model, the [Yaholnitsky Parabolic Cooker] (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/solarcooking/images/e/ea/T-188_PARABOLIC_TROUGH_BAKING_DEVICE%2C_Ivan_Yaholnitsky%2C_1-17-17.pdf/revision/latest?cb=20170117224820)

### Conclusions

While we managed to bake bread in the oven and reach a temperature of around 100Â°C, we find that the danger of the system being destroyed by wind is too high. Also, we think that using the calculated sun position is preferable to the sensor-based system. To address these issues, we are planning to develop a Fresnel mirror system.
