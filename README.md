## Welcome to Terlamonte Project

We are a place of learning, teaching and experimentation, and our aim is to support sustainable startups in rural contexts. You can visit us and we will serve you a curriculum based on your needs and interests, or help you out with possible business ideas, in exchange for volunteer work. We are currently planning the layout of our place and are making the first steps towards a solar kitchen.

### This website is under construction

In the weeks to come, this website will be updated with a more detailed description of who we are and what we do. We also plan to add a blog which will help us documenting our projects.
