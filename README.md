## Welcome to Terlamonte Project

We are a place of learning, teaching and experimentation, and our aim for the future is to support sustainable startups in rural contexts. You will be able to visit us and we will serve you a curriculum based on your needs and interests, or help you out with possible business ideas, in exchange for volunteer work. We are currently planning the layout of our place and are making the first steps towards a solar kitchen. We are making the first steps with our project, and your help with the initial preparations is very welcome!
